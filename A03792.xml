         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10014:4"/>The medicine is brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counſel &amp; frendly communica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, This (ſayeth Plutarche writinge to Apollonius) is to a ſycke mynd the beſt phiſicion. Wordes and voyces ſayth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race in his epyſtels do mytigate grefe, and put away the greateſt part of ſorowe.</p>
                  <p>Surelye I do thynke that lykewyſe as the diſeaſes of the bodye, as agues, heade ache, goutes, &amp; ſuch other, be healed by confections made of herbes, and other thinges procedinge out of the Apothecaties ſhoppe. So the diſeaſes of the mynd, be onelye cured with comfortable &amp; vnfeined wordes, flowyng out of a frendly and faithfull harte. Iſocrates in his Oration of peace ſaieth thus: I wolde ye ſhuld chefely knowe, that where

Wherfore Apollo counted chefe, and of the phiſicions in maner the god, in Ouide complayneth greuouſly, that the diſeaſe of his mynde, coulde be cured with no herbes, and that the artes whiche dyd profytte euery man, coulde not refrayne his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blouſe affection.</p>
                  <p>I wold wyſh the muſes were ſo fauourable vnto me, that I myght gather ſuche herbes in their gardens, that wolde ſo wel purge your mynde of this ſaide heauynes, as it is not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued in any man that is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of reaſon, but ſpecyally in

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit (Alas ſo great is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blindnes of our ſoliſſhe nature) we thinke thoſe thynges which are not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to be lamented, and thoſe whiche be not horrible in deed, greatlye to be feared.

Or els we may be iuſtly aſſembled vnto ragynge Aiax, which in his fury, and madnes, vſed the hogges which god had

True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye who ſoeuer is of this opyny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in my iudgemente ſemeth to be ignoraunte that God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidente and carefull for men. Alſo to lacke the knoweledge of his mooſte holy and holeſome ſcryptures. Math. 10. writeth that a ſparowe, which is a byrde of ſmall eſtimacion, can not fall to the grounde, withoute oure heauenly father, neyther a heere of a mans heade. And ſhall we whiche be the ſhepe of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, his people and his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, whom he regardeth a thowſand tymes more then the ſparowes,

Who is ſo folyſh to thinke, that god regarding the heeres of our heades, which be neither great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable, nor neceſſary, wyll contemne and neglecte thinges which pertayne to the ſuſteining and neceſſitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole bodies?

<pb facs="tcp:10014:8"/>is manifeſt in the hiſtory, theſe were nothing els but meanes or inſtrumentes which the lorde v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the perfourmaunce of his wyll. The holy Iob of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten men muche to be folowed, after that he hadde loſt all, and brought in maner to extreme mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſerye, dyd not accuſe his carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for buyldyng of a ruynous houſe, neyther he cryed oute of fortune as the vnfaithful do, nor yet founde faute at his herde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in that they droue not his cattell diligentlye into the ſafe ſtables: but conſidering the true cauſe of his calamitie and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chidnes, ſayd theſe wordes: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked I came frome my mothers wombe, and naked I ſhall go hence. The lorde dydde gyue me welth, and the lord hath taken it awaye. As it pleaſed the lorde, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:10014:9"/>it is done, his name be bleſſed. The blindnes of the elder Toby happening by ſwalowes donge that fell into his eyes as he laye ſlepinge, and the pouertie which dyd ſuccede, ſemed to be aſcribed onelye to chaunce. But the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel declared at the laſt that god dyd make hym both blynde and beggerly and that for a purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Dauyd in his Pſalmes doth euidently ſhew that our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties come none otherwiſe, but by the wyll and permiſſion of god: whiche tryeth vs as the golde is tryed in the fyry fornace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge neuer the worſe therfore, but better, &amp; purer.
